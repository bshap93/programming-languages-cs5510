Homework solutions to my programming languages class.

The course is taught by Matt Flatt (creator of Racket), and we use a dialect called plai-typed (created for use with the textbook, Programming Languages: Application and Interpretation).

The assignments roughly follow our forays into building up an interpreter for a custom language. Both the language being designed/parsed/interpreted ('book language'), and the language doing the interpreting (plai-typed), are (mostly...) functional languages.
